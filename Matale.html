                    <h2>Overview</h2><br>
                    <p>Muthumariamman Temple, also known as Arulmigu Sri Muthumari Amman Kovil is an ancient, colourful temple in Matala, Central Province, 
                        Sri Lanka. The name of the temple can be broken down into three parts, 'muthu' meaning pearl, 'mari' means rain and Amman means mother. 
                        Thus, this temple is dedicated to Mariamman, the goddess of rain and fertility. It is a magnificent, colorful temple, with tall towers, 
                        intricate carvings and realistic statues of gods and goddesses.<br><br>
                        The temple area was originally part of a paddy field, with a small statue under a tree, visited by the Hindus in Matale.The temple was 
                        built in 1874 by Nagalingam, his son Ramanath and around 100 designers, painters and architects from Tamil Nadu, and funded by Nattukkottai 
                        Chettiar. It contains 1008 statues of Hindu gods, and a beautifully decorated, 108 feet high Gopuram (tower) called Raja Koburam. This 
                        Buddhist and Hindu temple was immensely damaged during the anti-Tamil riots in July 1983, but it was immediately restored.<br><br>
                        Muthumariamman temple has five decorated chariots which represent different Hindu deities. The chariots parade around the town 
                        in a ceremony called Ther or Vettai Thiruvizha. This ceremony takes place on the day before Medin Poya, or Poya Say in March.The magnificent, 
                        colourful temple, with its tall towers, intricate carvings and realistic statues of gods and goddesses make it the pride of religion in Sri Lanka. 
                        Apart from being religiously and culturally significant for the Ceylonese, Muthumariamman temple in Matale is also a frequently visited 
                        tourist destination.<br></p>

                            near the Rattota town. The falls are mighty and at the same time, pleasant. Two falls subside here. 
                            A small fall is hidden inside the jungle and is named ‘Kuda Bambarakiri Ella’ where ‘Kuda’ implies 
                            ‘little’. The primary falls allow tourists to sit peacefully and enjoy the sound of splashing water.<br><br>
                            A rope bridge also exists which stretches over the falls is an excellent addition to the scenic beauty.

                            as the Bambarakiri Ella falls is not safe for swimming and bathing. The falls are divided within three 
                            cascades that is the tallest slope, the natural pool and the slope at the edge of the natural one, which

                        <p>Kallebokka 3600 viewpoint (height: 1,175m) became a trending destination after it was 
                            promoted by a certain TV programme. The summit is located right on the border of Matale 
                            and Kandy districts and shares the same ridge that forms Hathale min-worlds end and 
                            Hunnasgiriya mountain. The said ridge extends to the north and joins with western 
                            massif of Knuckles.<br><br>
                            On a clear day, visitors can observe Central Highlands, Kandy City, Sembuwatte 
                            lake and Knuckles Mountains.<br><br>
                            A Camping site and 02 estate bungalows are available for visitors to stay but need to be 
                            booked early. There is a half-finished Hindu shrine at the center of the flat summit and 
                            a hut made using sticks to enjoy the vistas. It’s better to visit in the mornings to enjoy 
                            the unobstructed views for mist tend to cover the area in the afternoons.</p><br>
